            <h1>Style Guide</h1><br>
            <hr><br>
            <h2>Target Audience</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Many high school teachers use WHE for their courses. Always write with a high school student in
                    mind, as we want them to be able to understand and grasp our content.</li>
                <li>This should not lead to oversimplification, though: we still want university students and academics
                    to find our content useful, at least for a general overview of the subject.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Writing Style & Tone</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>"Story" is the key part in the word "history", and our content should reflect that.</li>
                <li>Make your text interesting, exciting and a pleasure to read. You can be funny too!</li>
                <li>Avoid jargon and try not to sound overly academic; we are not lecturing.</li>
                <li>Focus on being clear and easily understood.</li>
                <li>Avoid long sentences.</li>
                <li>Be factual; don't speculate.</li>
                <li> Be as neutral as possible, including using gender-neutral language, and treat every culture or
                    belief system
                    equally.</li>

                <li> Grab the reader's attention from the beginning: your first paragraph should give the reader the
                    most
                    important information while encouraging him/her to read further. Tell the reader why he or she
                    should care
                    about your topic. Be straightforward.</li>
                <li> When appropriate, include a wrap-up at the end that discusses legacy; influences on later events,
                    people, or
                    ties to the modern world (what the site is like today or a popular movie in which the person is
                    portrayed,
                    for example).</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Written Content Types & Specifications</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>All text submissions should be between 1,500 and 3,000 words in length.</li>
                <li>Definitions: Definitions are an introduction to a topic. In your first paragraph, be sure to specify
                    what your topic is and include dates when applicable (birth and death of a person, beginning and end
                    of a war, reign of a king, etc.).</li>
                <li>Articles: Articles usually provide a more detailed discussion of a topic and are often more
                    academic. For example, while the definition "Ziggurat" provides the basics about ziggurats, an
                    article could be "The Role of the Ziggurat in Mesopotamian Cities" or "An Analysis of Mesopotamian
                    Ziggurats and Egyptian Pyramids".</li>
                <li>Titles of definitions and articles should be as concise as possible. A concise subtitle may be added
                    (but is not compulsory) in order to better define the main title (if required) or develop reader
                    interest in the subject. Both the title and subtitle have a 60-character limit. Subtitles should not
                    include punctuation marks such as colons, semicolons, dashes or hyphens. All titles should use the
                    most common English spelling: "Constantine the Great" or "Hoplite" or "Ziggurat". </li>
                <li>When you submit a definition or an article, we recommend that you also submit images to be used with
                    them. If you want to use images in the text, submit the images first. Refer to the "Images" section
                    below for guidelines.</li>
                <li>Be factual; don't speculate.</li>
                <li> Plagiarism and AI-assisted writing is strictly forbidden. Such content is automatically rejected,
                    and plagiarizing authors are not allowed to resubmit. </li>

            </ol>
            <h2>Bibliography / Sources</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>We expect all textual contributions to have a bibliography with a list of sources used. The
                    bibliography is an important element of our publishing criteria; we expect our authors to use a wide
                    range of academic works.</li>
                <li>At least half of your sources should be from academic books or journals, as, sadly, online sources
                    still don't give our readers the same level of trust as print material does (even though there are
                    some great online sources). Wikipedia is not an acceptable source.</li>
                <li>Please use the bibliography/references section to create your bibliography, and don't list it inside
                    your article. Use the book search in the bibliography tool, as this will create links to where
                    readers can find the books.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Numbers, Dates & Measurements</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Numbers up to twelve should generally be written as words; numbers from 13 upwards should be written
                    with digits.</li>
                <li>Use BCE / CE for dates instead of BC / AD.</li>
                <li>Centuries are written as numbers, for example "8th century BCE", not as words.</li>
                <li>Dates with BCE or CE following them should be separated by a space, for example: "323 BCE".</li>
                <li>Approximate dates are given with circa in front of them. If a date range is approximate, add the
                    circa in front of each date, separated by a space: circa 1000 BCE to circa 800 BCE. </li>
                <li>Life dates of a person do not require either "lived" or "l." before the date but other words before
                    a subject's date(s) should be written in full, e.g. "reign", "circa", "born" (when no death date),
                    and "died" (when no birth date). </li>
                <li>Date ranges should be connected with a hyphen, e.g. "1400-1450 CE". If anything else needs to be
                    inserted between the numbers, such as a "circa", the word "to" should be used instead of a hyphen;
                    e.g. "c. 1400 to c. 1450 CE".</li>
                <li>All numbers must use (,) as thousand-separator and (.) as decimal-separator, e.g. "1,324,000.07".
                </li>
            </ol>
