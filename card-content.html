            <hr><br>
            <p>The First Battle of Panipat, on 21 April 1526[1] was fought between the invading forces of Babur against
                Ibrahim Khan Lodi, the Sultan of Delhi, in North India. Babur's forces, employing gunpowder firearms and
                cannons, defeated Ibrahim. This was one of the earliest battles involving gunpowder arms on the Indian
                subcontinent. The victory marked the beginning of Mughal rule in India.</p><br>

            <h1>Details</h1>
            <hr><br>
            <p>In 1504, Babur succeeded his late uncle Ulugh Beg II by force of arms, taking control of the latter's
                kingdom based around Kabul and Ghazni. Opposed by Muhammad Shaybani to the northwest, Babur sought to
                expand his kingdom to the southeast, into Punjab, the land of the five rivers. By 1519, he had reach the
                Chenab River.[3]
                <br><br>
                At that time, most of North India was part of the Delhi Sultanate, under rule of Ibrahim Lodi of the
                Lodi dynasty. However, Ibrahim was locked in a power struggle with his relatives and ministers. Daulat
                Khan Lodi, Governor of Punjab, offered to defect to Babur.[4] Babur started for Lahore, in 1524 but
                found that Daulat had been driven out by forces sent by Ibrahim.[5] The Lodi army marched out to engage
                Babur and was routed.[5] Babur also took control of Jhelum, Sialkot, Kalanaur and Dipalpur before
                returning to Kabul. He placed Dipalpur under control of Alam Khan, a rebel uncle of Ibrahim.[6]

            <h1>Battle</h1>
            <hr><br>
            <p>Ibrahim's army is reported to have had an effective strength of between 50,000 and 70,000 with 1,000 war
                elephants but lacked gunpowder arms.[8][9][10] Babur's army was 12,000 strong. At least part of the
                force were equipped with matchlock muskets. His cavalry fought as horse archers. He also had between 15
                and 20 cannon.[11]</p><br><br>
            <p>Babur defended his position with 700 wagons tied together in a line. Between every second wagon was a
                breastwork for his musketeers to fire from. At several places in the line, he left sally points 150
                riders wide for his cavalry to advance through. Babur secured his right flank against the city of
                Panipat. On the left, he dug a trench filled with branches as an obstacle against cavalry.[12]

                When Ibrahim attacked, the frontage presented by Babur was too narrow for him to effectively employ his
                force. Musket and cannon pinned Ibrahim's centre while horse archers harried the flanks and rear. The
                noise of cannon panicked the elephants, adding to the casualties. Ibrahim and 20,000 of his men were
                killed in the battle. Thousands more died as the army retreated</p><br><br>

            <h1>Aftermath</h1>
            <hr><br>
            <p>The battle of Panipat was militarily a decisive victory for Babur. However, to secure his position, Babur
                was still to fight the Mewar ruler Rana Sanga at Khanwa in 1527 and, the eastern Afghans at the Ghaghra
                River in 1529. Politically it gained Babur new lands and initiated a new phase of his establishment of
                the Mughal Empire in the heart of the Indian subcontinent an empire that lasted for over 200 years.</p>
