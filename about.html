        India's History is a non-profit organisation that publishes free historical content
        to improve history education in India.

      <h2>
        Our Mission
      </h2>
      <p>

        Our mission is to engage people with cultural heritage and to improve history education.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h2>
      Why We Exist
    </h2>
    <p>
      History education shapes how we understand ourselves, our societies, and our view on the future. In today’s
      world, understanding history isn’t a luxury—it’s a necessity. Quality history education
      gives people the tools to recognize bias, resist manipulation, and engage thoughtfully in civic life. It teaches
      that the past is complex, that narratives can conflict, and that truth must be grounded in evidence.
      <br><br>
      Yet easy to understand historical resources of academic quality remain out of reach for millions of learners
      worldwide.
      <br><br>
      We exist to change that by making comprehensive historical knowledge freely accessible to everyone, helping people
      develop the critical thinking skills needed to navigate our complex, interconnected world. We believe that access
      to historical knowledge is a human right that should be extended to all.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>
      What We Do
    </h2>
    <p>

      India's History is a leading non-profit organisation with a mission. Since our inception
      in 2025, we have made history education freely accessible to everyone, everywhere.

          <p>
            We provide trustworthy historical information that readers can depend on.
            In an era of misinformation, we maintain rigorous editorial standards to ensure our content reflects current
            scholarly consensus and is thoroughly fact-checked, as very piece of content is reviewed by multiple team

        How We Do It

      <p>
        Our editorial content is rigorously researched, peer-reviewed, and authored by historians, archaeologists,
        educators, and scholars from around the globe. This expert authorship contributes to our status as a trusted
        resource in classrooms and universities, recommended by esteemed institutions such as Oxford University,

        Our Impact
      </h2>
      <p>

        Since our founding in 2009, we have grown from a small history website to become <b>the world's largest and most
          popular history encyclopedia.</b> Our reach demonstrates the global need for quality historical education

      <h2>
        Looking forward
      </h2>
      <p>

        Today, we continue expanding our impact through innovative approaches to historical education. We are developing
        new resources for educators, exploring partnerships with schools and universities, and using technology to make
        historical knowledge more accessible than ever before. We are expanding our reach by developing a mobile app,
        ensuring that quality historical content is available whenever and wherever our readers want to learn, including
        offline reading capabilities for those without consistent internet access.
        <br><br>
        Our commitment remains unchanged: to provide free, high-quality historical education that builds historical
        literacy and helps create a more informed, understanding world.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Our Story
      </h2>
      <p>

        World History Encyclopedia was founded in 2009 by Jan van der Crabben, who recognised that the internet lacked a
        comprehensive, reliable resource for historical education. Originally launched as Ancient History Encyclopedia,
        we rebranded in 2021 to reflect our expanded coverage of world history.
        <br><br>
        From the beginning, our approach has been rooted in the understanding that history is interconnected rather than
        linear. This philosophy shapes how we present historical knowledge, helping readers understand the complex
        relationships between different cultures, periods, and events.
        <br><br>
        As a registered non-profit organisation, we remain committed to transparency and accountability. We publish
        annual reports detailing how we invest donations and membership revenue in our mission to advance historical
        literacy worldwide.
