            <h2>Publishing Agreement</h2>
            <p>By submitting a work of authorship the contributor ("You") agrees to this License Agreement (this
                “Agreement”) with World History Publishing Ltd doing business as World History Encyclopedia (“WHE”):</p>

            <p>1.License. You hereby grant to WHE: (A) an exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable license to publish,
                reproduce, distribute, transmit, perform, display, store, translate, create derivative works from, and
                otherwise use the articles, images, illustrations, educational materials, designs, layouts, translations
                and any other works of authorship You contribute to WHE (Your “Work”) for any purpose, including
                commercial purposes, in any form, manner, format, or medium, whether now known or hereafter developed,
                throughout the world and in any language; and (B) the right to sublicense any of the rights granted
                above in this Section 1.
                If WHE publishes Your Work on its website at worldhistory.org or successor domains (the “Website”), the
                rights granted in the preceding sentence will remain exclusive to WHE for one year from such
                publication; provided thereafter You shall not distribute, publicly perform, publicly display, or
                otherwise publish Your Work without clear and prominent attribution to WHE as the original publisher. <br> <br>
                Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, WHE’s exclusivity will be perpetual.
                Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, You recognize and agree that: (i) WHE may license Your
                Work under a Creative Commons Attribution NonCommercial ShareAlike License, so that it may be passed on
                and used by others for non-commercial purposes; (ii) WHE may license Your Works under a more restrictive
                license, including any license suitable for the applicable medium and platform of publication; (iii) WHE <br><br>
                may remove Your Work from the Website or other publication for any reason, even after Your Work was
                previously published; and (iv) WHE may publish derivative works of Your Work as social media posts or
                advertisements or as part of a book or other publication.
                You recognize and agree that You have no right to prevent publication, distribution, or any other use of
                the Work by WHE or third parties, and you hereby waive any such rights. If WHE breaches this Agreement,
                Your sole remedy will be damages, not any injunction against such publication, distribution, or other
                use.</p>

            <p>2.Attribution. If it publishes Your Work, WHE shall attribute it to you as the author, and it shall
                require that any third party receiving your Work from WHE for publication agree to the same attribution.
                Your consideration pursuant to this Agreement includes, without limitation, such attribution and
                publication, except as set forth in the next sentence; provided additional compensation may be due
                pursuant to Section 3 below. However, if Your Work is so modified or combined that Your contribution is
                not material, in WHE’s reasonable judgment, no attribution is required.</p> <br>
            <p>3.Compensation. WHE shall have no obligation to compensate You for Your Work, irregardless of whether it
                is published or not. You are submitting Your Work on a volunteer basis.
                If WHE receives cash payment from selling Your Work or licensing the rights to use Your Work to third
                parties, WHE shall pay You 30% of the net profit directly attributable to Your Work. If Your Work is
                part of a collaborative creation involving multiple authors, WHE shall pay Your share of net profits
                above only in proportion to Your contribution to the whole creation, in WHE’s reasonable discretion.
                (Examples of collaborative creations include, without limitation, text supplemented by photographs or by
                editorial and design work, as well as books containing text by multiple authors.)
                You recognize and agree that: (a) you have no right to compensation related to Your Work except as
                specifically set forth in this Agreement; and (b) WHE may distribute Your Work without receiving a
                profit or net profit, or any cash compensation, in which case you will receive no cash compensation.
